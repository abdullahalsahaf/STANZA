# STANZA — Premium Professional Writing Firm

STANZA is a high-end, responsive single-page web platform built using **React, Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS v4, and Framer Motion**. It offers a premium, modern digital experience tailored for clients seeking executive-grade writing services (Statements of Purpose, Motivation Letters, Premium Cover Letters, and CVs).

## 🎨 Design System & Visual Aesthetics

STANZA is engineered around a **Dark Corporate Luxury** theme.
- **Color Palette**: An elegant mix of deep slate/black canvas (`#060a10`), rich neon **Emerald Green** accents (`#10b981`), and sleek **Platinum White** typography (`#f0f2f5`).
- **Glassmorphism**: Floating panels utilizing `backdrop-filter` blur with micro-border glows that respond dynamically to hover actions.
- **Anti-Gravity Micro-Animations**: Smooth scroll-triggered floating translations, soft ink-drop loops, and interactive background particle fields driven by Framer Motion.
- **Custom Brand Iconography**: A custom geometric fountain pen nib logo representation embedded cleanly across the navigation and branding sections.
